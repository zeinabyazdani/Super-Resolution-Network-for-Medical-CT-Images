This repository contains an unofficial Python implementation of the Super-Resolution Network with Information Distillation and Multi-Scale Attention for Medical CT Images. The model enhances the resolution of medical CT scans by leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, including:

Information Distillation to extract and refine essential features

Multi-Scale Attention Mechanism to capture fine-grained details at different resolutions
